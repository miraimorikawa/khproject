        <h4>Hey! It's been a while since the last time I've posted, right?? (haha). Not much been going on lately, been busy with class and stuff (Youth Stuff lol) <br> but the good news is... Kaihou Project is still ongoing. (not feeling bored yet)</h4>
	<p></p>I can't make that much songs lately, either the coding and work. Maybe it's due to my college "busy-ness". <br><br>Anyway, there are two modes of sound (for music) in the game which is MIDI and WAV. The WAV one, well the HQ version. And the MIDI one is the Microsoft GS Version.
	<br>Maybe you have heard some of it (MIDI) in Touhou Project right? The MIDI is for low specifications computer that cannot handle WAV files. Well, nowadays, all of the latest computer should handle WAV fine, so why included it in the game? <br><br>Well, just for fun I guess  ^^')\
	Well, of course, I kinda want to share the midi, can be good for arrangements purposes right? (haha)</p>
