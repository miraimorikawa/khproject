        <p>~ "Main Menu's Theme.<br>
        <br>
        I don't know what to make so I have been experimenting around,
        Turns out this one kinda magical (lol).<br>
        It's kinda resemble the game atmosphere and I like it.<br>
        
        How about you? Personally, I do think that it sounds a little bit harsh for a first game, right? (haha)."</p>

        <br>
        Just a weird simple song, I tried my best making it as the first stage impressions.<br> 
        Melody is rythmical too so you won't feel bored."</p>

        <p>~ "Caleoptera Eido's Theme.<br>
            <br>
            This is such a short song *I would say. It's really fit with her personality, since she is the kind of person *(bug) who playfully like to fight and take chalenges. I also gave it a Japanese sort-of vibe too~
            <br>
            Man.. Nothing can beat tea, it was so delicious! An upbeats song like this, really makes me want to do more (lol)."</p>

            <br>
            It's interesting how this one turns up.
            But to be honest, I'm not that much of an expert in making such a "adventuring" vibe thing.
            <br><br>
            It does sounds great though, so I hope this will do it."</p>

            <br>
            I tried to capture the traspassing kind of atmosphere where the enemy shows here.
            <br>
            This is the type of song where it's easy to make at first but then you realize how hard it is to make it flow well throughout the entire theme. (haha)."</p>

            <br>
            In a mountain full of magic mist, filling the atmosphere.<br>
            I made this with a passion of making the third stage longer than the previous stage. I also gave it a strange kind of vibe.
            <br>
            This song is really something if you started listen to it for a long time."</p>

            <br>
            For some reason, it kinda sounds like a stage theme doesn't it?
            <br>
            I kinda went on "Oujou-sama" type of vibe. It sounds awesome somehow lol.
            It is hard to make Faster Melody like this you know."</p>
